# lawyerFix - Web App 
### The website offers an efficient, accessible and above all headache-saving service for law firms.
After several conversations with lawyers from different fields, we discovered gaps in communication between clients and lawyers. The clients call every hour, WhatsApp messages and phone calls that invade privacy.The common need, both lawyer and the client, led us to think of 'LawyerFix' - an organized system with which the office will work, which allows a full reflection of the situation of the client's case.
